#### Lesson Summary:

This less revolves around several think-pair-share activities. It starts with a brainstorm of what data science processes students have previously engaged with. From there, two formal framework for data science are investigated. From there, another think-pair-share activity is conducted before reflecting on student's previous projects. The lesson then concludes with a summary and exit ticket.

#### Topic:

Data Science Frameworks

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students will be able to break a data science process into distinct stages using the OSEMN or CRISPR Framework.
* Students will be able to reflect on their previous experience conducting data sciene pipelines and outline which stages were strongest or weakest.

#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Previous experience with data science pipeline useful but not required.
